The data pipeline shown is a cloud-native architecture of Taxi service . The process begins with raw data ingestion into Cloud Storage, orchestrated by Cloud Composer (using Apache Airflow) to move the data through various stages. After transformation, the data is stored back in Cloud Storage, and then loaded into BigQuery for querying. Finally, Looker is used to visualize the results of these queries, providing insights based on the data processed in the pipeline.
